    `0` is selected than any pixels will be changed to background and this
    tool functions like an eraser. The size and shape of the cursor can be
    adjusted in the properties widget.

    In FILL mode the cursor functions like a fill bucket replacing pixels
    of the label clicked on with the current label. It can either replace
    all pixels of that label or just those that are contiguous with the
    clicked on pixel. If the background label `0` is selected than any
